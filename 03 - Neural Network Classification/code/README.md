# Neural Network Classification

- <a href='./01 -  NN Classification.ipynb'>NN Classification</a> 
    - Make use of `sklearn` demo data called `make_circle`
    - Use `accuracy` as metrics and result is converted to percentage. 
    - 50% accuracy means that the **model is guessing**.
    - `plot_decision_boundary()` function

- <a href='./02 - Non-linearity.ipynb'>NN Classification Non Linearity</a> 
    - Try out tensorflow playground
    - Change activation to `non-linear`
    - Replicate `Sigmoid` function
    - Visualizing history to plot model loss curves
    - Finding best learning rate using `callbacks`
