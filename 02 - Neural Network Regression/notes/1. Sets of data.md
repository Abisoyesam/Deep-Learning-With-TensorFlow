# The 3 sets...

**Traning set:** the model learn from this data, which is typically 70 - 80% of the total data available.

**Validation set:** the model gets tuned on this data, which is typically 10 - 15% of the data available.

**Test set:** the model gets evaluated on this data to test what is learned, this set is typically 10 - 15% of the total data available.

### Analogy

Assume the *training set* is the course material you use for study as a student in a university. The exam past question is the *validation set* which you use to prepare or validate how good/bad you can attempt likely questions in your exam. 

Your final exam is the *test set* to check how much you have learned and understood the course material. To evaluate the knowledge gained throughout the semester. If you've learned well, you should be able to perform well in the final exam you haven't seen before.

However, machine learning model is expected to learn patterns on the training set so that they can perform well sample (test) set that it has never seen before.
