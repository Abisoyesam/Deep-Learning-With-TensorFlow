    - Get the images from Food 101 dataset
    - Inspect directory and data with `os` module
    - Visualize random food images
    - Building my first CNN model

    - Replicate tensorflow playground model
    - Improve the model to help with better prediction, not guessing.
    - Increased trainable param result to better model performance.
